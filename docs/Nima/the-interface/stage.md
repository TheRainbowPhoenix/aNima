## Select Behind Objects

When you hover over an object on the stage, Nima draws an outline around it. This is a hint to let you know that if you click, this object will be selected. Sometimes multiple objects can overlap one another, making it difficult to select the exact one you want. In this case, press `**ALT**` to cycle to the next object under your cursor. You can continue to press `**ALT**` until the object you want is outlined. Now click to select it.

You can also right click on the object you want to select. Nima will present a menu with a list of all the objects that are directly below the cursor.
