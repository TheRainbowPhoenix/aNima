# Export Image Sequence
![[Pasted image 20231015040222.png]]

Export a sequence of PNGs, TGAs, or a GIF of your selected animation. Image sequences are exported at your FPS setting in the [Animation Panel](/nima/the-interface/animation-panel).

Make sure you've properly set the length of your animation to avoid exporting unwanted images.
