# Assets
![[assets_intro.gif]]

Add assets to your project by dragging and dropping them into Nima. You can also press the plus icon next to the Assets folder (in the [Hierarchy Panel](/nima/the-interface/hierarchy-panel)) to browse for your files.

Items that have been added to your project will appear in the Assets folder. Drag these onto the stage to position them.

You can also drag images from the Assets folder directly onto an object in the Hierarchy. This will make the asset a child of that object and position it accordingly. Place an asset at the center of the stage by dragging to the top level of the Hierarchy. Dropping the image on an object in the Hierarchy will make it a child of that object.

## Supported Assets

Nima supports most popular image formats, image sequences, and PSD files (8-bit mode). Be sure to flatten any PSD layer effects before importing into Nima.

### PSD

Imported PSDs appear as a single top-level asset (with a PSD icon), which can be expanded to reveal all the layers included in it. Most of the time you will want to work with the top level asset. Dragging this top level asset onto the stage (or onto the Hierarchy) will automatically position all the layers.

### Image Sequences

Import an image sequence into Nima by dragging and dropping multiple images that are named sequentially (e.g. image_000.png, image_0001.png, image_0002.png, etc). Make sure you select all the images that are part of the sequence.

## Replacing Assets

Select an asset and click on the Replace button in the Selection Panel to pick a replacement. You can also drag and drop a replacement image into Nima when an asset is selected under the Assets folder. You'll be asked whether you want to replace the currently selected asset or import the dragged file as a new asset.

If you drag and drop a PSD with the same name as a previously imported PSD, you'll see a similar notification.
