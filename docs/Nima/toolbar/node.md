# Node Tool

![[Pasted image 20231015035320.png]]

A Node is the simplest type of object in Nima. It has transform properties (translation, rotation, and scale) and can be a parent or child of other objects. Every object in Nima (images, bones, etc) are an extension of the Node object, with additional properties.

Use Nodes as containers for other objects (like a group) or as a way to add an extra transform space to your objects (e.g. to rotate an image, or a group of images, on a custom pivot point).

To active the Create Node tool, press `**G**`. You can also press `**CMD/CTRL**`+ `**G**` to group all selected items into a new node.
