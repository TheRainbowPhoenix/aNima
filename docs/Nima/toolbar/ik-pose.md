# IK Pose Tool

The IK Pose tool allows you to quickly manipulate the rotation of multiple bones.

To use the IK Pose tool, first select the bones you want to manipulate. Multi-selecting bones determines how far up the chain the IK Pose tool will go. With the tool active (press `**W**`) click and drag on an empty area of the stage. The red dot that appears on the screen represents the target that your bone chain is trying to follow.
