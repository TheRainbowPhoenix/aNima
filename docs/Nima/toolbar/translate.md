# Translate
![[translate_drag.gif]]

With an object selected, click and drag in the empty area of the stage in both X and Y.

If no object is selected, Nima allows you to marquee select (regardless of what tool is active). If an object is already selected, you can marquee select by holding `**SHIFT**` (to add) or `**ALT**` (to subtract).

###  Handles

Use the handles to limit your movements to just one axis. You can also use the handles to scale and rotate your selection, without having to switch to their respective tools. Note that when using the scale handle, you can hold `**SHIFT**` to lock the scale proportions.

##  Axis Options and Handles

By default Nima displays translate handles in Local space. Switching to World or Parent coordinates will update the handles accordingly. The Selection panel will continue to show Local coordinates regardless of what axis options are enabled for the handles. This is because all animation is done in Local coordinates.
