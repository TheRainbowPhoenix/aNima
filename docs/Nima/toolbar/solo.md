# Solo Tool
![[create_solo.png]]

The Solo object is similar to a [Node](/nima/toolbar/node) but it adds the ability to toggle the rendering of nested objects. It works like a radio button, so it will de-activate other objects on the same level. This is much faster than having to animate the opacity of each object individually.

In the example above, we quickly toggle between different eyes for the robot character.

Like all other objects in Nima, Solo objects can be nested. Use this technique to create more complex toggles.

To active the Create Solo tool, press `**Y**`. You can also press `**CMD/CTRL**` + `**Y**` to group all selected items into a new Solo.
